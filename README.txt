Unreal Engine 4 - Base multiplayer game using blueprints only

Guides used to replicate this:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXMTHrLWFKQ
- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwmGmCVti_dDl8CMa_91FdwgZ0W010d5v

Git video is used primarily so that it can be used as reference in case other people (e.g. people that make models) have a guide to get it to work too.
Playlist is used to replicate a simple base multiplayer setup. Slight changes have been added to test. 

The idea is that this "start up" can be used in the future for "any" kind of multiplayer game I'd like to start making. 
This means any commits after the entire guide setup will be useful for future projects.
